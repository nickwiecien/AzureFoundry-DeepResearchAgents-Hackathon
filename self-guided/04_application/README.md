  --ingress external
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Connection refused" errors**:
- Ensure Deep Research API is running on port 8000
- Check firewall settings
- Verify API endpoint configuration

**"Agent not found" errors**:
- Verify `AGENT_ID` environment variable
- Check Azure AI Foundry agent configuration
- Ensure API has proper Azure credentials

**Slow or incomplete responses**:
- Check Azure service quotas and rate limits
- Reduce depth/breadth parameters
- Monitor network connectivity

**Report formatting issues**:
- Verify markdown rendering in Streamlit
- Check for special characters in responses
- Review unsafe_allow_html settings

### Performance Optimization

**For faster responses**:
- Reduce research depth (2-3 levels)
- Lower breadth settings (2-4 questions)
- Use more specific research queries

**For comprehensive reports**:
- Increase depth settings (4-5 levels)
- Higher breadth for broader coverage (4-6 questions)
- Use detailed report prompts
